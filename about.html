          The Smart village executers believe in gaining the respect and
          confidence of the localists of the village. In doing so, their
          motive is to abide by preserving the traditions and cultures of the
          area while they subtly introduce the various technologies and its
          advancements. Like so, this development would ameliorate their
          existing resources without hampering their style and standards of
          living. <br> <br> This project will help the village to overcome its hurdles
          by bringing it closer to its success path through electricity and
          the cellular network. In the process of enhancing its assets, it
          will be introduced to the new digital trends as well as sustainable
          agricultural technologies through a variety of STEM lectures. This
          will help the village and its people to be self-reliant, making a
          step towards becoming <strong>‘ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT’</strong>.
