            The Smart village executers believe in gaining the respect and
            confidence of the localists of the village. In doing so, their
            motive is to abide by preserving the traditions and cultures of the
            area while they subtly introduce the various technologies and its
            advancements. Like so, this development would ameliorate their
            existing resources without hampering their style and standards of
            living. <br> <br> This project will help the village to overcome its hurdles
            by bringing it closer to its success path through electricity and
            the cellular network. In the process of enhancing its assets, it
            will be introduced to the new digital trends as well as sustainable
            agricultural technologies through a variety of STEM lectures. This
            will help the village and its people to be self-reliant, making a
            step towards becoming <strong>‘ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT’</strong>.
